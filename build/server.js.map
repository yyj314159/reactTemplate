The plugin is called <strong>Widgster</strong>. For now it\n                  has the following essential widget features:\n                </p>\n                <ul className=\"text-list\">\n                  <li><strong>Collapse/Expand</strong>\n                    ` - all widgets can be collapsed to fill only header&#39;s vertical space;`\n                  </li>\n                  <li><strong>Close</strong> - closable. Any widget may be removed by\n                    clicking the close btn;\n                  </li>\n                  <li><strong>Full Screen</strong> - an option to make widget fill the\n                    whole window (just like OS);\n                  </li>\n                  <li><strong>Ajax Load</strong> - the hottest option allowing to load/reload widget\n                    content asynchronously. You just need to provide an url to fetch the data\n                    from.
